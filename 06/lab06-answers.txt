Q1 What is the symbol for the exclusive OR operator in Java?

The bitwise ^ operator performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation.


FileInputStream
Q2 What is this class meant for?

FileInputStream is meant for reading streams of raw bytes such as image data. For reading streams of characters, consider using FileReader.


Q3 Write a statement that uses a constructor to create a new FileInputStream and opens a file for reading.

FileInputStream s = new FileInputStream("file");


Q4 What method do you use to read a single byte? What does it return?
read()
returns: the next byte of data, or -1 if the end of the file is reached


FileOutputStream
Q5 What is this class meant for?
FileOutputStream is meant for writing streams of raw bytes such as image data. For writing streams of characters, consider using FileWriter.


Q6 Write a statement that uses a constructor to create a new FileOutputStream and opens a file for writing.

FileOutputStream outS = new FileOutputStream(file);


Q7 What is the signature of the method which writes single bytes?
write(int b)


Q8 What method should you call when you are finished writing output?
finalize(); or close();

Q9 Both of the programs you will implement require you to use the command line arguments. To get some practice with this, write a program (you donâ€™t have to compile it) which takes two arguments. The first argument should be a word and the second argument should be a number which determines how many times to print out the word.

public class Echo {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        for (String s: args) {
            System.out.println(s);
        }
int firstArg;
if (args.length > 0) {
    try {
        firstArg = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
        System.err.println("Argument" + args[0] + " must be an integer.");
        System.exit(1);
    }
}

    }

}
