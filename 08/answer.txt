Q1 What two ways can you use to create a thread? Explain each in a couple of sentences.

1.To declare a class to be a subclass of Thread. This subclass should override the run method of class Thread.
2.To create a thread is to declare a class that implements the Runnable interface. That class then implements the run method.

Q2 Whichever way you choose to create a thread, what is the name of the method that must
be part of your threadâ€™s implementation?
Every thread has a name for identification purposes. More than one thread may have the same name. If a name is not specified when a thread is created, a new name is generated for it.

Q3 What method does a program call to start a thread running?
start()

                int port = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
                Socket socket = new Socket(args[1],port);
                System.err.println("Connected to "+ args[1] + "on port"+port);
                new ReadWriteThread(socket.getInputStream(),System.out).start();
                new ReadWriteThread(System.in, socket.getOutputStream()).start();
        }catch (Exception e){
               e.printStackTrace();
               System.err.println("\nUsage: java Client <host>");
